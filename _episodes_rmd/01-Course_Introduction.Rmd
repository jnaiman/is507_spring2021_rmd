Our main motivation for this course is to try to answer the question:  "How well can we know anything, really?"

In particular, some of the things we want to know are:
 * What kinds of questions can we ask with data?
 * How accurately can we answer those questions from a particular
dataset? How does this depend on features of this dataset (e.g.
how data was procured)?
 * How can we make predictions from collected data? What is the "accuracy" of those predictions?
 * How can we use computational tools to answer statistical questions?

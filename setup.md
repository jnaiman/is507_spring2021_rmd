## Setup Instructions

You will need to have both **R** and **RStudio** installed.

**R** and **RStudio** are separate programs. R is the underlying statistical computing software, but using R alone is more difficult and obscure. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.

R - links to install R can be found [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

RStudio (optional, but highly recommended) - links ot download can be found [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There are paid version, but we will be using the free version, so make sure you download that one.

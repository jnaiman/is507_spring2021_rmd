# Why take Statistics as an Information Scientist?

Our main motivation for this course is to try to answer the question:  "How well can we know anything, really?"

In particular, some of the things we want to know are:
 * What kinds of questions can we ask with data?
 * How accurately can we answer those questions from a particular
dataset? How does this depend on features of this dataset (e.g.
how data was procured)?
 * How can we make predictions from collected data? What is the "accuracy" of those predictions?
 * How can we use computational tools to answer statistical questions?

# Reading and Plotting Data with R

We'll be grabbing some data from [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) which has a lot of great examples of ways to "lie" with data by showing correlations and implying causation.  In particular we'll be looking at the relationship between cheese consumption and engineering Ph.D.'s awarded per year:

<img src='../figure/chart.png' width="70%">

To remake this plot, we need to first have the data to do so!  We'll enter this "by hand" by putting the data in with vectors, which in R are denoted by a `c()`:


~~~
year <- c(2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009)
mozz <- c(9.3, 9.7, 9.7, 9.7, 9.9, 10.2, 10.5, 11, 10.6, 10.6)
edocs <- c(480, 501, 540, 552, 547, 622, 655, 701, 712, 708)
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Basic plotting using R

Let's make a quick plot of some of this data:

~~~
plot(year,mozz)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-simpleplot-1.png" title="plot of chunk simpleplot" alt="plot of chunk simpleplot" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

What if we want nice red dots like on the website?

~~~
plot(year,mozz,col="red")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-simpleplot2-1.png" title="plot of chunk simpleplot2" alt="plot of chunk simpleplot2" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But hey, what about connecting them with lines?

~~~
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type='b')
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-simpleplot3-1.png" title="plot of chunk simpleplot3" alt="plot of chunk simpleplot3" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

What if we want more detail than the confusing "mozz" on the y axis?

~~~
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type="b", ylab="Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-simpleplot4-1.png" title="plot of chunk simpleplot4" alt="plot of chunk simpleplot4" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Changing the x-axis label

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Now let's plot the # of engineering docs as a function of time as well:

~~~
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type="b", ylab="Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb")
par(new=TRUE) # we use this to overplot
plot(year,edocs,col="black",type="b")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-spedocs1-1.png" title="plot of chunk spedocs1" alt="plot of chunk spedocs1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<!-- JPN: TBD will be to update this -- I feel like we could do more useful things here -->

But wait! the axis look horrible!  Let's try this again:

~~~
par(mar = c(5,4,4,4) + 0.1) # this just adds a buffer onto the right axis
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type="b", ylab="Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-spedocs2-1.png" title="plot of chunk spedocs2" alt="plot of chunk spedocs2" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Let's change the color of the axis for Per Mozz consumption:

~~~
par(mar = c(5,4,4,4) + 0.1) # this just adds a buffer onto the right axis
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type="b", ylab="Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb")

axis(2,col="red",col.ticks="red",col.axis="red",col.lab="red")
mtext("Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb", side=2, line=3, col="red")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-spedocs3-1.png" title="plot of chunk spedocs3" alt="plot of chunk spedocs3" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now, let's add back in the engineering PhD data:

~~~
par(mar = c(5,4,4,4) + 0.1) # this just adds a buffer onto the right axis
plot(year,mozz,col="red",type="b", ylab="Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb")

axis(2,col="red",col.ticks="red",col.axis="red",col.lab="red")
mtext("Per Capita Mozzerella Consumption in lb", side=2, line=3, col="red")

par(new=TRUE) # we use this to over plot
plot(year,edocs, type = "b", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylab = "", xlab = "")
axis(side = 4)
mtext("Engineering Doctorates", side = 4, line = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-spedocs4-1.png" title="plot of chunk spedocs4" alt="plot of chunk spedocs4" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Hurray!  We have a cool looking plot!

## Plotting Histograms in R

Maybe instead of a trend over time we want to know what is the distribution of the per capita cheese consumption. We can do this with the histogram:


~~~
hist(mozz,xlab="Per Capita Mozzeralla Consumption in lbs")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-hist1-1.png" title="plot of chunk hist1" alt="plot of chunk hist1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Here the y-axis is showing the frequency of a certain value - how often a value shows up in our data. It looks like ~9.75 and 10.75 pounds are the most frequent values.  

Its worth noting this distribution is somewhat "bimodal" in that there are sort of 2 distinct peaks.  However, the number of measurements is very small here, so its hard to tell for sure.  This could be a "unimodal" distribution peaked around 9.75 lbs.

## Summary statistics in R

We can also print out some summary statistics of our per capita cheese consumption vector:


~~~
summary(mozz)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   9.30    9.70   10.05   10.12   10.57   11.00 
~~~
{: .output}

We can also calculate these statistics seperately:

~~~
mean(mozz)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 10.12
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
median(mozz)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 10.05
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
var(mozz) # this is the "varience" which we'll discuss in a minute
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.2928889
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
sd(mozz) # this is the standard deviation
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.5411921
~~~
{: .output}

## Reading in and analyzing data with R

Let's try a larger dataset. In general to find data, check out data.gov or just google "statistical datasets" or there are some embedded in "R" as well, but let's try reading from a file first.

This is a file of random "tests" of before and after.  This is just a toy dataset but lets just say its a measure of resting heart rate before & after a drug trial.


~~~
mydata = read.csv("data/hr_trialData.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Other file locations
> Make sure this file is stored somewhere you can remember!  You can put it in the same directory as this file (or whatever R-script you are working from) or you can specify a location.  For example, on my Mac I can specify the default `Downloads` folder as the location with:
> 
> ~~~
> mydata = read.csv("~/Downloads/hr_trialData.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
> 
> Note: often times you'll see assignment happening in R with the `<-` symbols:
> ~~~
> mydata <- read.csv("~/Downloads/hr_trialData.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
> This is just another way to denote assignment, and works the same as an `=` sign.
{: .callout}

Let's take a look at our data:

~~~
print(mydata)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
   Before After
1      52    40
2      44    49
3      45    41
4      47    50
5      45    45
6      40    46
7      45    47
8      47    44
9      49    45
10     42    43
11     43    47
12     43    41
13     43    39
14     NA    42
~~~
{: .output}

Note, we can also just print out the first few rows of our dataset using `head`:

~~~
head(mydata, n=4)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  Before After
1     52    40
2     44    49
3     45    41
4     47    50
~~~
{: .output}

e can compare the print statement to [what is in the file](data/hr_trialData.csv) as well.   Notice there is an NA - this just means there is no data there.

Since its assumed folks are generally coming from an intro programming background using Python, we can first start by using R "Pythonically" and grabbing data into vectors of columns:

~~~
before = mydata[,1]
after = mydata[,2]
~~~
{: .language-r}

Check out the summary stats for both:

~~~
summary(before)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
     40      43      45      45      47      52       1 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
summary(after)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  39.00   41.25   44.50   44.21   46.75   50.00 
~~~

## Tips for the Homework

We see that the `before` vector has an NA $\rightarrow$ this just means there is no value there. We can see this if we look at the file **go to file** there is a missing value.  The `summary` function figures this out, but if we try to use any of the summary statistics functions "on their own" we can run into trouble.  For example:


~~~
mean(after)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 44.21429
~~~
{: .output}
is fine but:

~~~
mean(before)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}
does not work, we need to "take out" these missing entries:

~~~
mean(before,na.rm=TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 45
~~~
{: .output}

Let's practice making some more histograms.

~~~
hist(before)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h1p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h1p1" alt="plot of chunk h1p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But wait, let's label it:

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h2p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h2p1" alt="plot of chunk h2p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Let's label x & y too:

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms",xlab="count")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h3p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h3p1" alt="plot of chunk h3p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now let's overlay another histogram.

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms",xlab="count")
hist(after,add=T)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h4p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h4p1" alt="plot of chunk h4p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

But its hard to see what is going on, so let's start messing with the colors of each histogram.

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms",xlab="count")
hist(after,col=rgb(1,0,0),add=T)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h5p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h5p1" alt="plot of chunk h5p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Hmmm... but I feel like I want colors for both and maybe some transparency so let's try it!

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms",xlab="Count",col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5))
hist(after,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.5),add=T)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h6p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h6p1" alt="plot of chunk h6p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Let's also make sure we add a legend so we can tell what is what:

~~~
hist(before,main="Histograms",xlab="Count",col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5))
hist(after,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.5),add=T)
legend("topright",c("Before","After"),fill=c(rgb(0,0,1,0.5),rgb(0,1,0,0.5)))
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-h7p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk h7p1" alt="plot of chunk h7p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Using packages and Data in R

### Packages/Libraries

Let's look at how we can install data from R via packages.  For example, we can install the library `survival`:

~~~
install.packages("survival") # Note: this might take a little while!
~~~
{: .language-r}

If we have already installed this package, we can make sure to load it like so:

~~~
library(survival)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This contains data about survival rates of cancer.  Let's look at lung cancer.  Easiest thing to do is to just print out what we have for this dataset:

~~~
head(survival::lung)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  inst time status age sex ph.ecog ph.karno pat.karno meal.cal wt.loss
1    3  306      2  74   1       1       90       100     1175      NA
2    3  455      2  68   1       0       90        90     1225      15
3    3 1010      1  56   1       0       90        90       NA      15
4    5  210      2  57   1       1       90        60     1150      11
5    1  883      2  60   1       0      100        90       NA       0
6   12 1022      1  74   1       1       50        80      513       0
~~~
{: .output}
Note here that we use the `::` to specify we are using the `lung` data from the `survival` package.  Usually we won't be this explicit with naming, but it can be useful sometimes as often packages will name data/functions with the same names.

We can also check out the help pages for this package and dataset:
~~~
help(lung, package="survival")
~~~
{: .language-r}

From this we see that there are things stored in this dataset like the person's age in years, their sex (here just represented as a binary), and how long they've survived.

We can use this dataset much like the one we loaded from the CSV file:

~~~
time_in_days = survival::lung[,2]
hist(time_in_days)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-l4p1-1.png" title="plot of chunk l4p1" alt="plot of chunk l4p1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Data
There are also datasets "embedded" in R that are easy to use as well.  

To load a list of all R data packages:
~~~
data()
~~~
{: .language-r}

If the output of the `help` function is too confusing, we can always look at the top of the data:

~~~
head(ChickWeight)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  weight Time Chick Diet
1     42    0     1    1
2     51    2     1    1
3     59    4     1    1
4     64    6     1    1
5     76    8     1    1
6     93   10     1    1
~~~
{: .output}

Which shows the weight of a baby chicken on different diets.

One useful thing about help pages are that often there are examples.  We can run these with:

~~~
example(ChickWeight)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Don't worry if any output plots are confusing!  We'll talk more about them later in the course.

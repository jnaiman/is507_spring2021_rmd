<p>You will need to have both <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> installed.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the underlying statistical computing software, but using R alone is more difficult and obscure. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

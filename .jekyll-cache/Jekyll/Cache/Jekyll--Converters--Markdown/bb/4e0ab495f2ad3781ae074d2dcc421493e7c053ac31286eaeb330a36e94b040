I"j<p>Our motivation for creating this workshop is the recent, rapid increase in the volume of data produced on farms and the use of such data for decision making by farmers.  This material doesnâ€™t claim to replace the data analysis services that are currently provided by the agricultural technology industry, but rather to arm you with knowledge to help you better communicate with such service providers.  Moreover, we believe that your data will be more valuable to you if you have some ability to analyze it yourself, regardless of whether you continue to do business with a particular company in the future.</p>

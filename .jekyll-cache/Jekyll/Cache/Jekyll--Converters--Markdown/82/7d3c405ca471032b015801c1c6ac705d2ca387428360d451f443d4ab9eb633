<p>You will need to have both <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> installed.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the underlying statistical computing software, but using R alone is more difficult and obscure. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

<p>R - links to install R can be found <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>RStudio (optional, but highly recommended) - links ot download can be found <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>. There are paid version, but we will be using the free version, so make sure you download that one.</p>
